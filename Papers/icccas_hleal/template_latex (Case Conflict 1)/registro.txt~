Abstract:  	A numerical continuation for tracing a novel homotopy method for obtaining DC solutions of nonlinear circuits is proposed. The homotopy method is called double bounded homotopy and it is used to find multiple DC solutions with the advantage of having a stop criterion which is based on the property of having a double bounded trajectory. The main properties of this homotopy are explained by using the Lambert W function. Finally, key aspects of the implementetion of the numerical continuation for this new homotopy are explained.
