	Abstract=
		"A new method has been developed for solving a system
		of nonlinear equations g(x) = 0. This method is based
		on solving the related system of differential equations 
		dg/dt +- g(x) = 0 wherein the sign is changed whenever
		the corresponding trajectory x(t) encounters a change
		in sign of the Jacobian determinant or arives at a
		solution point of g(x)=0. This procedure endows the
		method with a much wider region of convergence than
		other methods (occasionally, even global convergence)
		and enables it to find multiple solutions of g(x)=0 one
		after other. The principal limitations of the method
		relate the extraneous singularities of the differential
		equations. The role of these singularities is illustrated
		by several examples. In addition, the extension of the
		method to the problem of finding multiple extrema of a
		function of N variables is explane and some examples
		are given" }

		"A new method has been developed for solving a system
		of nonlinear equations g(x) = 0. This method is based
		on solving the related system of differential equations 
		dg/dt +- g(x) = 0 wherein the sign is changed whenever
		the corresponding trajectory x(t) encounters a change
		in sign of the Jacobian determinant or arives at a
		solution point of g(x)=0. This procedure endows the
		method with a much wider region of convergence than
		other methods (occasionally, even global convergence)
		and enables it to find multiple solutions of g(x)=0 one
		after other. The principal limitations of the method
		relate the extraneous singularities of the differential
		equations. The role of these singularities is illustrated
		by several examples. In addition, the extension of the
		method to the problem of finding multiple extrema of a
		function of N variables is explained and some examples
		are given" }
