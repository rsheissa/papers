\section{Introduction}

This template provides formats and styles for ELEX manuscript. It is essential to adhere to this template because your manuscript will be published "{\it as is}" with minimal copy-editing by the publisher.  Do not modify formats (font, font size, paper size, printing area, line space, etc).  {\it Keep one copy of this template untouched for your reference and prepare your manuscript on another copy.}


\section{Software and article charge}


Microsoft Word and LaTeX compatible files are officially acceptable for ELEX submission. This template file is designed for MS Word.  LaTeX style files can be found elsewhere\cite{web link}.  Article charge is JPY~31,500 for a manuscript using MS Word template and JPY~21,000 for a manuscript using LaTeX style file. Including movie picture(s) costs extra JPY 3,150 per movie file.


\section{Manuscript length} 

Papers do not usually exceed six (6) pages of an A4-sized PDF file.  The first page contains paper title, author list, affiliation(s), 100-word-abstract, keywords, and references.  The main body of the text is limited to approximately 1,500 words.  Manuscripts are allowed to have up to three (3) display items (Figures and/or Tables) with brief captions in principle as long as the final PDF file size would not exceed 2 MB.  Including multimedia files (movie graphics) in a final PDF file is possible, if any, by using attachment function of Adobe Acrobat.


\section{Typographical style}


Consult with Table~\ref{tab:style} on the detail typographical styles.

\end{table}


\subsection{Title}

Title should start flush left.  Only the first letter in the title is capitalized (this is true to section titles and figure captions) Avoid including abbreviations unless definitely needed.


\subsection{Author name and affiliation}

Author names should start flush left.  Spell out both first and last names but initial middle name. Use one blank line between authors from different affiliations.


\subsection{Abstract}

The abstract should be complete sentence(s) that is limited to approximately 100 words.  It should be a concise summary of the paper that clearly conveys the problem, the methods, and the conclusions to readers.  It also should include appropriate keywords for the convenience of computer search.  Do not include reference numbers.

\subsection{Keywords}

Maximum six (6) keywords are listed.  Carefully choose appropriate keywords for your paper being correctly spotted by computerized search.


\subsection{Classification}

Category index in the classification is used by the ELEX Editorial Office when directing your manuscript to corresponding Associate Editor. Furthermore it is displayed in ELEX website and in archives for readers' convenience. Choose most relevant category from Table~\ref{tab:classification}. The Editorial Committee may change the subject index that authors select, if the Editorial Committee judges that the authors' selection is not the best.  Note that the index might be changed without notification.

\end{table}


\subsection{Main text and headings}

Single column format is applied throughout the manuscript. The first line of the first paragraph of each section start flush left.  Section headings are numbered consecutively in Arabic numbers.  Subsection headings are numbered in Arabic numbers to the right of the decimal point (like this 4.5).

\subsection{Equations}

Equations are centered with the equation number (in Arabic) appearing at the right-hand margin, in parenthesis:
\begin{equation}
T_{\mbox{M}}^{\phi} = 2 \times \frac{G w t^3}{3 l} \phi \left( 1 - \frac{192}{\pi^5} {\frac{t}{w}} \tanh \frac{\pi w}{2 t} \right).
\end{equation}
\noindent
Long equations can be folded in several lines but avoid leading to
misinterpretation.  Equations are referenced in the main text as Eq. (1).


\subsection{References}

References should appear on the first page of the paper, in the order in which they are referred in the main text.  See the example in this template for different styles for citing a journal paper, a whole book, a contributed chapter in a book and a proceeding paper.  WWW links can be placed as a reference.  It is authorsf responsibility to provide correct information of references. Use a pair of square bracket to cite reference like this [2].  Multiple references can be cited by using a hyphen like this [2-5].


\subsection{Acknowledgements}

Acknowledgements, if any, can be placed at the end of the manuscript.


\section{Display items (figures, tables, and movies)}

You may include total maximum three (3) pieces of display items in principle in a final PDF version of your manuscript but do not exceed 2 MB file size.

\subsection{Figures}

Figures should be placed in the document.  Do not submit figures in separate files.  Use LaTeX environment "\\begin{figure}" to place frames for figures. Place your figure as close to as the main text where it is referred.  Figure position in published paper may differ from that in your original file, when publisher adjusts the final format. Figures are numbered in Arabic numerals. Figures are referred as Fig.~\ref{fig:scanner} even at the beginning of a sentence. Figure captions are placed under corresponding figures.


\begin{figure}[htb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=8cm]{figures/lens_scanner.eps}
\end{center}
\caption{Include all graphics in the manuscript file.  Do not submit figures in
separate files.}
\label{fig:scanner}
\end{figure}



\subsection{Tables}

Tables are placed in the document in the same manner as figures.  Tables are referred in Roman numbers such as Table~\ref{tab:style}, without abbreviating to Tab.~\ref{tab:style}.  Table captions are placed above the corresponding tables.



\subsection{Movie files}

It is one of the ELEX features that author could include movie files (mov or mpg) in their final PDF manuscript.  Use file attachment tool of Adobe Acrobat (not Acrobat Reader):
\begin{enumerate}
\item Select the file attachment tool \includegraphics[width=5mm]{figures/pin.eps}.
\item Select the location where the movie file is placed (in the figure box).
\item Select the movie file from a dialog box.
\item In the comment properties, set the desired options, if needed.
\item Click OK
\end{enumerate}
Movie files are represented by an Adobe Acrobat icon (like this:\includegraphics[width=8mm]{figures/pin2.eps} ) and activated by clicking on it. To help readers, you need to place a snapshot of the movie file and place it as a figure.  Notice readers that a movie file has been attached (see Fig.~\ref{fig:movie}).

\begin{figure}[htb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=6cm]{figures/snapshot.eps}
\end{center}
\caption{Place a snapshot from the movie file to display for readers.  Movie can be activated by clicking on the icon.  Movie file attached.}
\label{fig:movie}
\end{figure}
